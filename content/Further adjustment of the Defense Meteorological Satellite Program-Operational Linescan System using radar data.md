In the past, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program—Operational Linescan
System (DSMP/OLS) data have been successfully adjusted based on the presence of vegetation
in each pixel. We propose a further adjustment based on radar data obtained by the SeaWinds
scatterometer. It is shown that the adjustment results in substantial accuracy gains, measured as
increased correlation with the more accurate Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite data as
well as with the existing instances of radiance calibrated DSMP/OLS data. The proposed adjust-
ment is easy to implement. The improvement of the proposed method is particularly significant
in arid regions where vegetation is relatively sparse.
