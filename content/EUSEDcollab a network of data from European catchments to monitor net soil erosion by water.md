summary: As a network of researchers we release an open-access database (EUSEDcollab) of water discharge and suspended sediment yield time series records collected in small to medium sized catchments in Europe. EUSEDcollab is compiled to overcome the scarcity of open-access data at relevant spatial scales for studies on runoff, soil loss by water erosion and sediment delivery. Multi-source measurement data from numerous researchers and institutions were harmonised into a common time series and metadata structure.

As a network of researchers we release an open-access database (EUSEDcollab) of water discharge and suspended sediment yield time series records collected in small to medium sized catchments in Europe. EUSEDcollab is compiled to overcome the scarcity of open-access data at relevant spatial scales for studies on runoff, soil loss by water erosion and sediment delivery. Multi-source measurement data from numerous researchers and institutions were harmonised into a common time series and metadata structure. Data reuse is facilitated through accompanying metadata descriptors providing background technical information for each monitoring station setup. Across ten European countries, EUSEDcollab covers over 1600 catchment years of data from 245 catchments at event (11 catchments), daily (22 catchments) and monthly (212 catchments) temporal resolution, and is unique in its focus on small to medium catchment drainage areas (median = 43 km2, min = 0.04 km2, max = 817 km2) with applicability for soil erosion research. We release this database with the aim of uniting people, knowledge and data through the European Union Soil Observatory (EUSO).

Bottom: summary-level empirical relationships found within the database entries, showing a) the relationship between catchment area (km2) and specific sediment yield (t km2 yr−1), and (b) the relationship between mean annual discharge (m3 yr−1) and the mean annual sediment yield (t yr−1) for all high temporal resolution datasets (excluding monthly data). The error bars show the variation of the annual sediment yield values around the mean annual average.](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-023-02393-8/MediaObjects/41597_2023_2393_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)
