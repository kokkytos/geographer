Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 24-h data are substantially affected by lunar illumination. A new method is proposed to correct this distortion and be able to form a consistent time series. The method has the advantage of being relatively simple in its deployment while at the same time effective. The results show that the proposed method removes periodical illumination noise due to the lunar circle while preserving meaningful information, in the test sites applied.
